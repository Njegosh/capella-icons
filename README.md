Capella Icons is currently a work in progress and lacks many icons for a full Desktop experiance.
As such there are certain milestones that need to be reached before it can be used for a full and 
consistent use on the Desktop.

- [ ] Icons for most Gnome and KDE software
- [ ] System Icons
- [ ] Device Icons
