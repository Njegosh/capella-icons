# Capella Icon Theme [WIP] #
A clean modern icon set for Linux Systems

## Icon identity ##
### General ###
- Icons are in simple recognisable shapes, mostly flat with Apps being the only ones using a slight gradient.
- Icons do not have perspective or depth, the only elements resembling depth are shadows used in App icons primarily to exaggerate certain elements.
- Icons share the same dimensions as their type (Apps are of the same dimensions as other apps, while files are the same dimensions as other files)
and only in certain cases can elements break the general shape of the icon (elements sticking out or transparency)

### Apps ###
All App icons are `64x64` however the main shape area is `56x56`.

Application icons can be categorised into 3 categories: **Pocket, Square, Circle**


Pocket | Circle | Square
------------ | ------------- | -------------
![Files icon](/images/examples/files.png)  ![Zipper icon](/images/examples/zipper.png) | ![Weather icon](/images/examples/weather.png)  ![Clock icon](/images/examples/clock.png)| ![Terminal icon](/images/examples/terminal.png) ![Calculator icon](/images/examples/calc.png) 
Mostly used | Used very often | Rarely used



## This project is a Work in Progress ##
Capella Icons is currently a work in progress and lacks many icons for a full Desktop experiance.
As such there are certain milestones that need to be reached before it can be used for a full and 
consistent use on the Desktop.

- [ ] Folders and core memetypes 
- [ ] Icons for most Gnome and KDE software
- [ ] System Icons
- [ ] Device Icons
- [ ] Symbolic Icons
- [ ] Extensive application Icons
- [ ] Extensive memetype Icons
