# Capella Icon Theme [WIP]
A clean modern icon set for Linux Systems

### This project is a Work in Progress ###
Capella Icons is currently a work in progress and lacks many icons for a full Desktop experiance.
As such there are certain milestones that need to be reached before it can be used for a full and 
consistent use on the Desktop.

- [x] Folderds and core memetypes 
- [x] Icons for most Gnome and KDE software
- [x] System Icons
- [ ] Device Icons
- [ ] Symbolic Icons
- [ ] Extensive application Icons
- [ ] Extensive memetype Icons
